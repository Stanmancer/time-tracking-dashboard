## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design provided as possible, practice working with JSON data - local `data.json` file is provided for the activities.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
-   The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week". For monthly, it should read "Last Month".
